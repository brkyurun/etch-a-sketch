# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project I have done as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. It is an online, in-browser version of etch-a-sketch written using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- Initialized with a 16x16 grid.
- Drag your pointer across the squares to paint them.
- Select "Rainbow" to turn on the funk!
- Click the "reset" button to create a new grid. You will be prompted with a confirmation, and to give a number between 2 and 65. Max cell-per-side is limited to 64 to not impact performance.
